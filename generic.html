							<h1 class="major">Big Budgets? Big Returns? - An Analysis of Film Industry</h1>
							<h3 class="tech-stack">Technologies Used: R | Statistics | Regression | Causal Inference</h3>
							<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>The movie industry is a multi-billion dollar business, and the budget of a film has become a crucial factor
in determining its success, particularly its Revenue.One of the drawbacks of existing research in predicting movie revenue is the difficulty in accurately capturing
the impact of other complex factors that influence a movie’s success apart from budget. </p>
<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The goal of the project is to explore the factors affecting movie revenue, beyond just the budget, to help filmmakers optimize their marketing and production strategies. Utilizing a comprehensive dataset and regression models, the study aims to provide insights and recommendations by analyzing various influencing factors. This approach seeks to overcome limitations in existing research and offer more accurate predictions for movie success, contributing to strategic planning in the film industry.</p>
<h2>Data and Methodology</h2>
<p>We gathered the dataset from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/akshaypawar7/millions-of-movies">Kaggle</a>. The dataset comprises metadata of more than 700,000 movies listed in
the TMDB Dataset. It has 722986 rows and 20 columns representing various factors influencing the movie’s
success. We performed exploratory studies and model building on a 30% subsample of the data. The remaining 70%,
totaling 9832 rows, is used for testing the model and evaluating the results in this report.</p>
<p>To meet the large sample assumptions, we evaluated the assumptions of Independence and Identical Distribution (I.I.D) and
	Unique Best Linear Predictor (BLP). From the exploratory data analysis, although the budget and revenue distribution was roughly identical, we observed that our dataset is not strictly I.I.D
	(further discussed in the Limitations section), and it does not have finite variance from the histogram plots, eventually violating the unique BLP assumption. We performed a log transformation of the predictor variables
	(budget and title length) to overcome this.<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="images/hist.png" alt="Linear Regression" width="500" height="400"></div> Because each movie is not subjected to multiple samplings, the dataset is regarded as cross-sectional. We cleaned data by ignoring the rows with missing values in all dependent and independent variables. From
the exploratory plots, we observed few outliers for budget, and we are considering the movies with a budget
greater than $999 and excluding movies with a budget greater than $799 million. After filtering the data,
we are left with a sample size of 9832 observations.We operationalized the variables Budget(X) and
Revenue(Y) in terms of amount (in dollars, $). The image below shows a plot of Revenue as a function of budget,depicting a linear relationship between the two variables.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="images/lr.png" alt="Linear Regression" width="500" height="400"></div>
<p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Based on a Pearson correlation analysis, we selected several covariates that show a significant relationship with the dependent variable, Revenue. Here's a concise overview of these covariates and their relevance:</p>
<ul style="margin-top: 0;">
    <li>Vote Count: Reflects public engagement with the film.</li>
    <li>Runtime: Influences the number of possible screenings and, by extension, profitability.</li>
    <li>Popularity: A multifaceted metric gauging public and online presence.</li>
    <li>Title Length: The brevity of a title may enhance its memorability and dissemination.</li>
    <li>Release Season: Aligns movie releases with peak holiday periods for better turnout.</li>
    <li>Release Language: Addresses the potential reach of a film based on the language of release.</li>
</ul>
<p>The plot below shows the “pearson” correlation between
the dependent and all independent variables. Based on the correlation score, we chose the following covariates
that affect the dependent variable (Revenue). The color shades are used to represent correlation, spanning
from dark red to dark blue. In this scheme, dark shades of red (+1.0) indicate a strong positive correlation
between variables, whereas dark shades of blue indicate a strong negative correlation (-1.0).</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="images/corr_plot.png" alt="Linear Regression" width="500" height="400"></div>
<p>Before running the regression model, we checked the multi-collinearity between all predictors by running a
variation inflation factor to reduce unstable and unreliable estimates of the regression analysis. We observed
there is no evidence of multi-collinearity between the predictor variables.</p>
<p>We created three regression models on the 30% dataset to understand better to understand the factors
contributing to the Revenue of a movie. The first model studied the correlation between budget and Revenue.
In the second model, we gradually added covariates such as ‘Vote Count’ and ‘Run time’. Finally, in the
third model, we added more covariates such as Popularity, Movie Title Length, Release season, and Release
Language.</p>
<p>The displayed equation represents the linear regression model used in our analysis. In this model, β0 denotes the intercept, providing the starting point of the regression line. β1 is the coefficient that quantifies the influence of the budget on revenue. Additionally, Z signifies a vector containing other relevant variables chosen for the model, while γ represents their respective coefficients, indicating the weight of each covariate in the model.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="images/eqn.png" alt="Linear Regression" width="400" height="50"></div>

<p>Additionally, we evaluated homoscedasticity to check if the variance of the errors or residuals in the model is constant across all the predictor variables using scale-location plot and Breusch Pagan test,
but the results showed heteroscedastic behavior.Since our dataset is large, we continued to build our model with robust
standard errors to handle the heteroscedastic behavior. Below is the scale-location demonstrating heteroskedastic behavior.
From below plot, we see that the red line on the plot is not horizontal and also the spread of the residuals is not equal at all the fitted values, highlighting evidences for Heteroscedasticity.

</div>
lm(log_revenue ~ log_budget + vote_count + runtime + popularity +
								log_title_length + release_date_cat + lang_cat)
<br/> <br/>


<p>We  also used Breusch-Pagan test to validate homoscedasticity. The null hypothesis(H0) of the Breusch- Pagan test is that the residuals are Homoscedastic.The alternate hypothesis(Ha) is that the residuals are heteroscedastic. If the p-value from the test is less than the chosen significance level (e.g., 0.05), we can reject the null hypothesis of homoscedasticity. From the bptest results, it is seen that the p-value (3.422e- 12) is less than 0.05 and we can reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is strong evidence of heteroscedasticity in the linear regression model.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: left;">Statistical Tests</h2>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">T-Test</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Below is the results of t-test highlighting the statistical significance of each and every predictor in the selected model. Since the model is of heteroscedastic, robust standard errors are used as an effective solution to handle it.
</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="images/t_test.png" alt="Linear Regression" width="400" height="200">

<h3 style="text-align: left;">Anova Test</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">We conducted anova test to find out best fitting model. Below results of anova test of the three models shows that model 3 is fitting better than other two models as it has significant F-statistic value along with lower residual sum of squares, low residual degrees of freedom and low p-value.
</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="images/anova.png" alt="Linear Regression" width="400" height="200">

<h3 style="text-align: left;">Wald Test</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">We conducted wald test to estimate the significant variables (whether the variables add any value to the model or not) from a set of predictors and found out that budget, vote count, popularity, runtime, movie title length, movie language category and movie release season from model 3 influences the revenue of the movie.
</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="images/wald.png" alt="Linear Regression" width="400" height="300">


<h2 style="text-align: left;">Results</h2>
<p>The image below illustrates the results derived from applying three distinct regression models to a subset, comprising 70% of the overall dataset.From the results, We  observe that model 3 has the highest adjusted R-squared value of 0.67, indicating
that it is the best-fitting model out of the three. A<p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="images/results.png" alt="Linear Regression" width="600" height="500"></div>

<p style="text-align: left;">The “Budget” variable has a strong positive relationship with revenue in all three models, with estimates
ranging from 0.91 to 0.77. All covariates, including vote count, runtime, and release season, are statistically
significant with p-values less than 0.05 (alpha level). The covariates vote count, runtime, and release season
show more statistical significance than other covariates.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">To better understand the practical significance of the results, let’s consider a hypothetical use case with 180 minutes movie being produced with a million-dollar budget with a shorter title length of 10, the Model 3 shows that the Revenue of the movie could increase by 77.2%. Similarly, the model also shows that for every movie which is released in the English language, the revenue of the movie is expected to increase by approximately 15.6% keeping all the other covariates constant. Likewise, on average, the model predicts if a movie gets released during December/January, the revenue of the movie is expected to increase by 18.1%.<p>

<p style="text-align: left;">These results emphasize that budget is a crucial factor in determining the Revenue of a movie. It also indicates that along with the budget, the other covariates are also having significance in determining the revenue of a movie. But considering the statistical significance of popularity, movie production firms should not spend more money in promotions. Having all these into considerations, we believe that Model 3 can assist movie production companies in making informed decisions about the various factors involved in the overall planning process, which is essential for the success of the movie.<p>


<h2 style="text-align: left;">Limitations</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">The Dataset has a chance of introducing Sampling Bias as the data about the movies is self-reported on TMDB, which is a user-generated content platform.
Thus, the dataset may represent some movies but the dataset cannot be representative of all movies that have been produced globally.
The data may also be biased toward movies that are more popular than others.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">The I.I.D assumption becomes questionable after closely examining the movie dataset because two movies may share the same cast & crew, and production company and have identical release dates.
We observed that the dataset has some omitted variables. For example, it does not mention any information about Motion Picture Association of America(MPAA) Ratings, which have the possibility of influencing the Revenue. Since MPAA rating are categorical, different MPAA ratings may generate different revenue. Here budget impacts the content of a movie which in-turn affects the rating of a movie, hence it is difficult to determine the direction of omitted variable bias accurately. Likewise, actors, a categorical variable, may influence both budget & Revenue of the movie where we may not be able to determine the direction of omitted variable bias.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
The dataset may not represent a true picture of the current movie industry/trends since it contains informa- tion on movies which has a release date before 2013. Moreover, there is no consideration of inflation when concluding the statistical analysis between covariates such as budget & Revenue. More inflation leads to more budget & revenue and the direction of the bias is away from zero.
Also, in the model, we have an outcome variable, “Vote count” on the RHS. This variable can be an outcome of the predictor “Popularity”. The reason could be because of promotions, more people can engage with the movie, which could lead to an increase in the number of votes.</p>


<h2 style="text-align: left;">Conclusion</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">This study estimated the economic value of movie production, specifically examining the relationship between movie budget and Revenue. We also found that several covariates, such as vote_count, runtime, popularity, title length, release season, and release language, have a significant impact on movie revenue. Additionally, we identified the holiday season and language as other important categorical factors that can impact the success of a movie. We hope that this line of work will provide filmmakers with accurate tools to plan their investments and optimize their production strategies, reducing uncertainty in the film industry. Future work may explore the correlation of Revenue with additional data like MPAA ratings, cast/crew information, and sequel information on previous releases for identifying the latest trends in the movie industry.
